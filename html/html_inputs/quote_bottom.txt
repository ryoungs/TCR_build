    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 10px">  The objective of "The Cat Room" is to present Cats at Animal Care & Control in a slightly different way. We hope to give potental adoptors and those looking for lost animals quick access to pictures and data. </a></p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 10px">  For more photos and information about fosters, <a href="foster.html">click here and go to bottom of the Foster page</a>!</p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 10px">   The Cat Room follows the terms and conditions of Anne Arundel County Animal Care & Control (AACACC).  All the photos and data come from the primary AACACC webpages.  With just one click, The Cat Room is accessible and quick to reach; it is especially helpful for those looking for a lost cat as it combines information (age, length of stay, sex, etc.) with a photo. In the future look for links to "The Cat Room" in social media.  Expect changes and an occasional oops.  We hope it is useful and results in more adoptions and redemptions.<p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 50px 20px"> The Cat Room will also be a place with feline behavior references as well as historical day to day statistics for the cats in the shelter's care.
